# Resume

This repository contains my personal website. 

This website is meant to be a way to display my web development skills.

I am currently studying web development and testing my skills by creating a website that mirrors my resume. 

At the moment, I have familiarized myself with HTML and CSS which is reflected in the website.

As I develop new skills, such as Bootstrap, Javascript, and more, I will update this website.
